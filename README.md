## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This is a readme file template for GitHub for mods developed and/or hosted at SHS. It is written in Markdown language. Although it is close enough to the HTML language, some formatting are not supported by GitHub, such as color display.

For each section, I took over, whenever possible, elements of readmes already published in order to maintain a semblance of consistency in the terms used. You just have to keep the ones you need (list of compatible games, installation procedures according to the platform, list of tools used...) and, for the rest, replace "MYMOD" and "Author" by the name of the mod and its author, modify links and fill in appropriate texts. For some sections,I have been as exhaustive as possible: all you have to do is to choose paragraphs you are interested in and delete the others.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on all Infinity Engine games. This includes:
- The series of Enhanced Editions published by Beamdog, which at present includes Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BGEE), Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition (IWDEE), and Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition (PsTEE). The BGEE Siege of Dragonspear expansion (SoD) is supported as well.

- The original Baldur's Gate II (BG2, or just SoA), with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion.

- The original Icewind Dale (IWD) with or without either of its expansions, Heart of Winter (HoW) and Trials of the Luremaster (TotLM).
- Icewind Dale II (IWD2).
- Planescape: Torment (PsT).

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

MYMOD is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. It has been tested on several different installations, and has so far worked perfectly. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please report them on the forum!

Though I am striving to make MYMOD compatible with as many other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. Below are the ones discovered thus far:
- mod 1
- mod 2
- ...


If you encounter any bugs, please report them on the forum! 

## 

#### Installation Order

>Although it is not required for the 1pp mod to function properly, BG2 and TOB players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

- Please install mymod before mod A.
- Please install mymod After mod B.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-mymod.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **mymod** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the Console window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly Avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG

Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

MYMOD for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer. 
Extract files from the archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using build-in "Right-click>Extract all..." Explorer fearure, <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, <a href="https://zipgenius.com/">ZipGenius</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: mymod folder and a setup-mymod.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-mymod.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-mymod.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

MYMOD for Mac OS X is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: mymod folder, setup-mymod and setup-mymod.command files in your game folder. To install, double-click **`setup-mymod.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.


Run **`setup-mymod.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

MYMOD for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-mymod`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-mymod --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.

## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component *`DESIGNATED`* number which gives it a fixed install position and allows automated installers to specify component choices.

>Optional: All subcomponents require the main component (they need to since it's the one that installs new content). All components are otherwise optional.
