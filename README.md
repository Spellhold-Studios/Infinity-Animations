## Introduction

This mod patches Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal to support additional creature and character animations (referred to as "animation slots"). It also offers a dynamic automated process for claiming new animation slots. Thus, it acts as a central hub, usable by anyone who would like to add animation entries to the game without being bogged down by issues of mod conflicts and incompatibilities.

Infinity Animations supports a wide variety of animation types from Baldur's Gate I, Baldur's Gate II, Icewind Dale I, Icewind Dale II, Planescape: Torment and Neverwinter Nights. As an added bonus, the mod restores Baldur's Gate I character animations in their entirety, and paperdolls have been unlocked for some animations that did not support them previously.

An important feature for players who use several large mods (known as "megamods") is a resolution of animation conflicts, and a restoration of standard animations that megamods have overwritten. Finally, this mod contains optional components that implement many new animations into the game. Ongoing work will address sound sets for new animations. While the number of supported animations may not be "infinite" as the name suggests, it should be large enough to accommodate everyone's present (and in all likelihood future) needs.

*Please check the complete [Readme](https://Spellhold-Studios.github.io/readmes/infinity-animations/infinityanimations.html) to learn more about this mod before installation.*
